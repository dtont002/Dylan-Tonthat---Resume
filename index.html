        <p class="lead mb-4">Undergraduate Student at the University of California Riverside<br><br>

        My name is Dylan Tonthat, and I am just coming off of my high school Mission San Jose and am now attending college at one of the most prestigious institutions in California. I am from the Bay Area from the town Fremont, so coming down here to Riverside has been an enormous change in pace. This new step of my life will now involve me being away from my home, my friends, and my family for the first time ever, as I learn and grow more as a person to become the best I can possibly be. As a person, I am highly career oriented and am willing to do whatever it takes to attain my goals of becoming a dentist. The thing about me is that I grew up in a sheltered community where Fremont was a bubble of like minded people. I myself did not know much about the outside world until now when I now have to come and approach different people and resources to attain the necessary needs I want. However, that could be a hard struggle for me as I am very introverted. 
	I chose to go to UCR as it is a heavy research based college where I know there would be many opportunities for me to seek out and take advantage of. Looking to attend grad school right after my four years here, I need to not only pass but thrive and succeed. I know that whatever my goal is, it is possible to achieve so long as I give my all into it. Not only that, I am taking this moment to learn how to live on my own away from my parentâ€™s shelter. This step of being 6 hours away from home will definitely shape me to become more independent and most likely even more thankful for my parents for all that they have done to raise me and nurture me into who I am today. I am sure I will miss them but I know that they are always behind me supporting me in the actions I take. Not only that, college is a time for a new beginning, away from the friends and classmates I have stuck to for the past 12 years of my life. Here I can change myself to be who I want to be and not who I am expected to be. I know that I donâ€™t have to fake anything about myself or my personality. I am looking to make new life long friends here which will be challenging but definitely achievable. I need to balance my school work and social life to make the best of both worlds. This is the moment for me to make something out of myself and to enjoy my youth.
<br><br>

        I am always seeking to learn, grow, and reach out for new opportunities. I believe my passion in science, strong work ethic, and positive attitude will be beneficial in my future prospects to attend dental school and practice within my local community.
